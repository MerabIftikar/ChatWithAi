Perfect 👍 You now have:

Frontend (React Native – bare, not Expo) → uses react-native-fs + notifee for downloads & notifications.

Backend (Node.js + Express + yt-dlp) → handles video download and serves file.

Here’s the full README docs for your exact setup 👇

📘 Video Downloader App – Documentation

This project allows you to download YouTube videos using:

📱 Frontend (React Native bare project) – For the mobile app

🖥 Backend (Node.js + Express + yt-dlp) – For downloading and serving videos

⚙️ 1. Requirements

Before starting, install these:

✅ Node.js (LTS)

✅ npm (comes with Node.js)

✅ React Native CLI

✅ Android Studio
 (for emulator / SDK tools)

✅ yt-dlp.exe
 → put in your backend folder

✅ Android device or emulator (for testing app)

📂 2. Project Structure

│
├── backend/             → Node.js backend
│   ├── server.js        → Express server
│   ├── yt-dlp.exe       → Video downloader
│   └── videos/          → Downloaded videos
│
└── frontend/            → React Native app
    ├── src/screens/DownloadVideoScreen.tsx
    └── package.json

🚀 3. Backend Setup
Step 1: Create backend project
mkdir VideoDownloaderApp
cd VideoDownloaderApp
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express cors

Step 2: Add files

Save your server.js inside backend/.

Download yt-dlp.exe and put it inside backend/.

Step 3: Run backend
node server.js


✅ Server will start at: http://localhost:5000
 (or your local IP).

📱 4. Frontend Setup
Step 1: Create React Native project
npx react-native init frontend
cd frontend

Step 2: Install required libraries
npm install react-native-fs @notifee/react-native @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler

Step 3: Link native modules
npx pod-install ios   # if using iOS


(For Android, just rebuild the project.)

Step 4: Add your screen

Place the code you provided (DownloadVideoScreen.tsx) inside:

frontend/src/screens/DownloadVideoScreen.tsx


Make sure you have navigation set up with NavKeys.ChatScreen.

Step 5: Run frontend
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios


✅ App will open in your emulator or real device.

🔗 5. How It Works

User pastes a YouTube video link in the mobile app.

App sends API request to backend:

POST http://<your-ip>:5000/download
Body: { "url": "<youtube-link>" }


Backend uses yt-dlp.exe to download video → saves it as MP4.

Video is saved inside backend/videos/.

Backend responds with a video URL (example: http://192.168.1.20:5000/videos/video_123.mp4).

App downloads that file into phone storage using react-native-fs.

App shows progress notifications (using notifee).

Once complete, app shows “Download Complete” with file path.

📚 6. Libraries Used
Backend

express → Web server

cors → Allow frontend to connect

yt-dlp.exe → Downloads YouTube videos

Frontend

react-native-fs → Save files to phone storage

@notifee/react-native → Notifications with progress

@react-navigation/native → Screen navigation

react-native-screens, react-native-safe-area-context, react-native-gesture-handler → Required for navigation

✅ 7. Final Steps

Start backend:

cd backend
node server.js


Start frontend:

cd frontend
npx react-native run-android


Paste YouTube URL in app → Press Download.

Video will be downloaded, saved in phone storage, and shown with notification progress.

📌 Summary

Two projects: backend + frontend

Backend handles video download with yt-dlp

Frontend (React Native) handles UI + notifications

Together → you get a Video Downloader App 🚀
